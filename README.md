# 🎯 Jeopardy Trivia Game (Work in Progress)

An Android trivia game inspired by *Jeopardy!* — built with **Android Studio** and **Kotlin (or Java)**.  
Currently under development as part of my ongoing learning in Android app design, OOP, and UI development.

## 🧩 Overview

This project replicates the classic Jeopardy format — categories, clues, and points — while introducing:
- Category-based question boards
- Timer-based gameplay
- Automatic score tracking
- Responsive design for both phones and tablets  

Built to showcase Android app architecture, OOP concepts, and local data management.

## 🧠 Features
  
✅ Score tracking and result display  
✅ Timer with sound effects for added challenge  
✅ Local data persistence using **SQLite** (or SharedPreferences)  
✅ Modular question-data system for easy expansion  
✅ Intuitive UI with **ConstraintLayout**, **Fragments**, and **Navigation Components**  
✅ Smooth lifecycle handling using Android’s **Activity** and **ViewModel** patterns
